# How it works

The user is confronted with a page that is the skeleton of the weather dashboard. There is a search bar on the left side of the screen, when the user types in a city he/she would like to find
weather information about, the current weather is displayed as well as the 5 day forecast. Each query the user logs is then saved and a button with that query is saved underneath the search bar. The user can then click on the previous cities and see the updated weather.

# Project-Status

To Do: Add the history to local storage so the 5 day forecast will update when the user clicks on a "history" button.
